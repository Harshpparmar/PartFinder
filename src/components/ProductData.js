    introduction: "The Modest AMD build guide is focused on providing the best performance per dollar on a mid range gaming PC. The components are straightforward to install and the system will run games at 1080p or higher without issue. If you are looking for more of a budget build you can take a look at our Entry Level AMD Gaming Guide",

    cpuDescription: "Our Modest AMD Gaming Build is centered around the newly released AMD Ryzen 5 5600X. Using the included CPU cooler you will be able to achieve moderate overclocks on this unlocked processor. ",

    motherboardDescription: "We're using a parametric filter for B550 mATX motherboards. Our compatibility and pricing engines will automatically select the best-priced motherboard that is compatible with the rest of the build.",

    memoryDescription: "We are filtering for a 2x8GB kit of DDR4 RAM with a speed of at least DDR4-3200 and maximum Cas latency of 16 as Ryzen CPUs scale well with faster memory.",

    storageDescription: "We're also using a parametric filter that will actively select the best-priced SSD of at least 1TB capacity. Solid states drives are significantly faster than hard drives and one of the easiest ways to improve system responsiveness and load times for both applications and games. Everyone's storage needs differ, so feel free to change the capacity to your usage.",

    gpuDescription: "The AMD RX 6800 is an excellent mid-range graphics card that will let you play any popular game available today at 1080p or 1440p, including Fortnite, PUBG, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Apex Legends. To keep the noise and temperatures down, the filter requires a minimum number of 2 fans to avoid 'blower' style cards, which usually do not cool the card as well.",

    caseDescription: "The Phanteks XT PRO ULTRA comes with one Type-A USB3 port, one USB3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port, a large tempered glass side panel and fits full-size graphics cards without issue. It provides several cable management holes as well as a mesh front panel for better airflow.",

    psuDescription: "For our power supply, we're using a parametric selection of well-reviewed units, all of which will provide more than enough power for this system.",

    caseDescription: "All of our components are housed in the Fractal Design Pop Mini Air case. This case comes with two USB3 ports, an optional USB-C port (requires a separate purchase), a large tempered glass side panel and fits full-size graphics cards without issue. It provides several cable management holes as well as a mesh front panel for better airflow.",

    psuDescription: "We're using a parametric selection of well-reviewed units, all of which are 80+ Bronze certified or above and can provide plenty of power for this build. Note that because there are issues with PSU availability right now, some non-modular PSUs have been added to the build to help you get the parts you need. These are still high quality PSUs.",

    motherboardDescription: "We're using a parametric filter to constantly select the best-priced motherboard while meeting selected criteria. In this case, we are filtering for ATX and mATX motherboards with B550 chipsets and up to 4 DDR5 DIMM slots for future expansion. The compatibility engine will filter out anything not compatible with the build, and it will automatically update with the best priced option as prices change.",
    
    memoryDescription: "We are filtering for the best-priced 2x16GB kit of DDR5 RAM with a speed of at least 6000 and a maximum CAS latency of 30",

    gpuDescription: "The AMD Radeon RX 6800 will let you play all modern games at high settings with smooth fps.",

    caseDescription: "All of our components are housed in the Corsair 4000D Airflow. This case features an all black design with a tempered glass side panel and mesh front panel. It includes one front panel Type-A USB 3 port, one USB3 Type-C port, hidden PSU mount, and a number of cable management holes and tie-offs to help your build look tidy. The case can also comfortably fit full-sized video cards and large CPU coolers.",

    psuDescription: "We're using a parametric selection of well-reviewed units, all of which are 80+ Bronze certified or above and can provide plenty of power for this build. Note that because there are issues with PSU availability right now, some non-modular PSUs have been added to the build to help you get the parts you need. These are still high quality PSUs.",

The parametric filter is constantly updating to show the best priced product based on the specifications we have set.",

    memoryDescription: "We are filtering for a 2x8GB kit of DDR4 RAM with a speed of at least DDR4-3200 and maximum Cas latency of 16 as the Core i5-12400F scales well with faster memory.",

    storageDescription: "We're also using a parametric filter that will actively select the best-priced NVME M.2 SSD of at least 1TB capacity. Solid states drives are significantly faster than hard drives and one of the easiest ways to improve system responsiveness and load times for both applications and games. Everyone's storage needs differ, so feel free to change the capacity to your usage.",

    gpuDescription: "The AMD RX 6800 is an excellent mid-range graphics card that will let you play any popular game available today at 1080p or 1440p, including Fortnite, PUBG, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Apex Legends. To keep the noise and temperatures down, the filter requires a minimum number of 2 fans to avoid 'blower' style cards, which usually do not cool the card as well.",

    caseDescription: "The Phanteks XT PRO ULTRA comes with one Type-A USB3 port, one USB3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port, a large tempered glass side panel and fits full-size graphics cards without issue. It provides several cable management holes as well as a mesh front panel for better airflow.",

    cpuDescription: "At this budget, we're running the Intel Core i5-13500. The 13500 features 6 Performance-cores with Hyperthreading, 8 Efficient-cores, and will perform exceptionally well with all your gaming needs. While it is not overclockable and does come with a stock cooler we have added the Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE ARGB to the build for better cooling and to reduce the noise level.",

    motherboardDescription: "We're using a parametric filter to constantly select the best-priced motherboard while meeting selected criteria. In this case, we are filtering for ATX B760 motherboards with four DDR4 DIMM slots. While there is a small performance increase from DDR5 memory it significantly increases the cost of both the motherboards and DIMMs",

    memoryDescription: "We are filtering for a 2x16GB kit of DDR4 RAM with a speed of at least DDR4-3200 and maximum Cas latency of 16 to target the sweet spot for the 13500.",

    gpuDescription: "For our GPU, the newly released NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER is one of the better price for performance cards on the market. The RTX 4070 SUPER will provide a consistent 60fps on many demanding games like PUBG at Ultra at 1080p, and even 1440p for some games like Apex Legends. It'll also handle Fortnite with zero issues. For those interested in VR, this card will have no problem playing any and all applications currently on the market.",

    caseDescription: "All of our components are housed in the Deepcool CH360. This case comes with one USB3 port, a USB-C port, a large tempered glass side panel and fits full-size graphics cards without issue. It provides several cable management holes as well as multiple mesh panels for better airflow.",

    cpuDescription: "The Ryzen 5 5600G is an APU, which can adequately serve the role of both CPU and GPU. It has 6 cores and 12 threads, with a boost clock of 4.4 GHz and is aptly suited for all software in the Microsoft Office suite or the comparable open source offerings.",

    motherboardDescription: "We are using a parametric selection of motherboards that will be compatible with the Ryzen 5 5600G. They also include 2-4 DIMM slots for up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM.",

    memoryDescription: "For this build and most machines outside of the top end we opted to go with 16GB of DDR4 memory with CAS latency no higher than 18 clock cycles. The parametric filter finds the best price on 2x8GB kits of memory that are within AMD’s recommended specifications. We've limited it to DDR4-3600 or faster, as modern CPUs scale well with higher frequency memory.",

    storageDescription: "We're also using a parametric filter to select the best priced NVME SSD available that is at least 1TB. Everyone's storage needs are different, so feel free to change drive capacity or add a drive to fit yours.",

    gpuDescription: "The Ryzen 5 5600G's iGPU provides this build's graphics processing. It can play many games on lower settings and lets you bypass the need to find a GPU in stock. This build does not use a discrete GPU, but you can easily upgrade to one after saving up more money.",

    caseDescription: "The Fractal Design Core 1000 USB 3.0 is an mATX mini tower case with one front panel USB 3.0 Gen 1 port, front panel USB2.0 port, optical drive bay and it fits most full-size graphics cards without issue.",

    psuDescription: "We're using a parametric selection of well-reviewed units, all of which are 80+ Bronze certified or above and can provide plenty of power for this build. Note that because there are issues with PSU availability right now, some non-modular PSUs have been added to the build to help you get the parts you need. These are still high quality PSUs",
